description: Two-pass vault analysis. Pass 1 finds structural drift and offers auto-fixes. Pass 2 surfaces content-level issues for review.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
version: 0.1.0
---

> **Frontmatter audits** in passes 1 and 2 check files against the canonical schema in `obsidian-bridge:vault-standards`. Load that skill before flagging missing/malformed properties so violations are scored against the real spec, not an inferred one.

`/dream` performs a deep analysis of vault data, surfacing issues that accumulate silently across sessions. This is not a status report — it's a diagnostic.

## Scope

Default: current project only (read `project_slug` from breadcrumb). `--vault-wide` scans all projects. `--save` persists the report to `projects/{slug}/dreams/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Token Budget

`/dream` is the hungriest command. Mitigations:
- Read frontmatter first; full body only when needed for content checks.
- Summarise findings as the scan proceeds; don't accumulate then dump.
- Target: complete project dream in <5 minutes wall time.

## Pass 1 — Structural Sanitation

Scans for auto-fixable drift and manual-decision items.

## Pass 2 — Content Analysis

Report-only findings. Never auto-actioned.

```pseudocode
content_findings = {
    contradictions: [],
    stale_info: [],
    dangling_scopes: [],
    unacted_decisions: [],
    documentation_gaps: []
}

FOR each slug in slugs:

    // 1. Contradicting information
    // Scan brief, decisions, sessions for conflicting statements:
    // - Decisions that contradict each other (e.g., "chose REST" vs "using GraphQL")
    // - Brief stating one stack but decisions referencing another
    // - Scope "out" items appearing in later sessions as completed
    decisions = read all decision files (frontmatter + body)
    brief = read brief body

    FOR each pair of potentially contradicting claims:

        })

    // 2. Stale information
    // - Decisions marked "active" but >30d with no recent references
    // - Brief sections unchanged since creation
    // - Session notes referencing components that may no longer exist
    FOR each decision with status "active" AND date > 30 days ago:

                suggestion: "update, archive, or mark implemented"
            })

    // 3. Dangling scopes
    // - Scope "in" items never appearing in session summaries
    // - Parking lot items never revisited
    // - References to "next session" or "follow-up" with no subsequent entry
    IF brief contains scope sections:
        scope_items = parse scope in/out items from brief

            })

    // 5. Documentation gaps
    // - Sessions with no decisions (notable work happened but wasn't captured?)
    // - Brief missing core sections for its type
    // - Empty stub files

## Personality Layer

When cabinet is installed and active, the chronicler voice (Bostrol/Kevijntje/Jonasty) wraps the report. Bridge detects cabinet via the `crew/` folder and adjusts formatting if the current session is a `/cabinet` session. Without cabinet, `/dream` is dry — no personality, no flair, just the report.

---

## When to Suggest

Bridge does not auto-suggest `/dream`. The command is always explicit. If cabinet is installed, cabinet's suggestion logic applies (Kevijntje suggests at 5+ sessions, 14+ days idle, or 3+ scope drifts).
